# The function check_password(password) is used by a safe with 4-digits passwords, and is susceptible to timing attacks.
# More specifically, it takes it around 0.1 seconds to check one digit â€“
# so brute-forcing all the possible combinations will take more than an hour.
# Can you implement a way to crack its password in less than a minute?
